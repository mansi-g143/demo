My first demo repository...

Commands to push to GitHub:
- If a new repository
  - clone: git clone "repository url"
  - Add content
  - Commit using: git commit -m "any message"
  - git push origin "branch-name" (to check Branch name: use "git branch", to modify branch name: use "git branch -m old-branch new-branch")
  - git push origin "branch-name"

- If already created project:
  - git init (to initialize git repository in a project, git starts tracking the files in the folder)
  - git status (to check what all files and folders are changed)
  - git log (to check all the git commits previously done locally)
  - To track all files: git add .
  - To track particular file: git add ./file-name.something
  - To commit: git commit -m "commit message"
  - To push to a remote repository: git push origin "branch-name"
